# arduino_synth
An arduino software mapping a joystick shield for arduino to musical notes and chords.

The idea is to map the analog stick 8 directions to the seven notes of a scale (plus the octave) and the four buttons to chord qualities: major, minor, augmented and diminished.

TODO:
  - ~~Map analog stick directions to 8 square waves tones~~ - DONE
  - ~~Use a DAC to create different wave forms (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth)~~ - DONE
  -  Amplify signal to line level 
  -  Combine three or four waves to form a chord
  -  Implement different chord qualities
